In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with `async/await` within a `useEffect` hook in a client component.  The issue stems from the fact that `useEffect` runs on the client, while data fetching often happens within server components.  If the client component attempts to access server component data before it's fully fetched and resolved, it will result in unexpected behavior or errors. This is particularly problematic if the server component's data fetching involves an API call or a database query.
